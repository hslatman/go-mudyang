# mud.yang.go

Generated Go code for working with [Manufacturer Usage Descriptions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8520/) (MUDs).

## Description

This repository contains a package with generated Go code for working with [Manufacturer Usage Descriptions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8520/) (MUDs, RFC 8520).
The code is generated by [openconfig/ygot](https://github.com/openconfig/ygot) which uses [openconfig/goyang](https://github.com/openconfig/goyang) for parsing and compiling YANG files.
The (required) YANG files were sourced from [yangmodels/yang](https://github.com/YangModels/yang).

## Usage
 
See main.go

TODO: elaborate.

## Examples

Currently three example MUD files are provided in this repository:

* lightbulb2000.json. The example from RFC 8520.
* amazonEchoMud.json. Source: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/mudprofiles
* wemoswitchMud.json. Souorce: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/mudprofiles

The MUD files for Amazon Echo and the WeMo Switch have been manually updated to conform to the current version of the RFC and/or make them valid MUD files according to the code generated by [openconfig/ygot](https://github.com/openconfig/ygot).
These changes included the following fields:

* ietf-access-control-list:access-lists -> ietf-access-control-list:acls
* ethernet-acl-type -> eth-acl-type
* ethertypes hex string to integer

## Development

A slightly patched version of `goyang` is used to generate the code.
